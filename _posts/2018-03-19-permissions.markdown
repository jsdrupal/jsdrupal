This blogpost is a small incremental success we had in the JS initiative.
Last week we merged the first iteration of a permissions page.
Let's see what it looks like:

![A gif of the new permission UI]({{ "/assets/permissions.gif" | absolute_url }})

There are few things to point out:

* For now it looks really similar to the permissions page in Drupal. We are looking forward to work together 
with the [Usability team](https://groups.drupal.org/usability)
* A feature we managed to implement: Dynamic filtering as you type. We believe these small UX improvements can make a huge difference, as you can quickly filter for example by everything related to the "Page" content type.

As you can imagine improving the user experience of Drupal is a huge undertaking. The technical side is
actually by far the easiest bit. Coming up with good, simple but also flexible design patterns is much harder. We need help, so please [get involved](https://jsdrupal.github.io/get-involved/).
