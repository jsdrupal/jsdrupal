As of today we've merged the first iteration of a better permissions page:

![A better permissions UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1090713/37614021-c8b23380-2b66-11e8-80bc-fc791835d0d8.gif)

As you can see on this preview: We've added support to filtering permissions by name. This gives you an easy way to for example
find all permissions related to users, or a specific content type.

We started to look into actually improveing the Design / UX of this page, so please stay tuned and [Get involved](https://jsdrupal.github.io/jsdrupal/get-involved/).
